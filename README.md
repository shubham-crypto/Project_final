TITLE: URBAN PLANNING AND CITIZEN ENGAGEMENT PLATFORM

**Concept of the Project**:

The Urban Planning and Citizen Engagement Platform seeks to revolutionize local governance by enabling timely and ongoing citizen participation in urban planning procedures. This platform empowers local governments to collect valuable community input prior to making important decisions, guaranteeing that projects are in line with the needs and priorities of the local area. With its array of features like proposal submissions, idea voting, discussion forums, and real-time updates, the platform aims to create an open, inclusive, and collaborative atmosphere. The platform will be enhanced with the integration of GIS features, providing interactive maps, spatial analysis, and data visualization. Ultimately, the platform aims to foster trust, encourage public participation, and cultivate a collective sense of ownership in urban development projects.

**Problem Statement**:

Public consultations on large-scale development projects in many urban areas around the world often take place at a stage when key decisions and financial commitments have already been made, which can be problematic. This final consultation stage restricts the community's ability to impact project results, eroding trust and diminishing the effectiveness of public engagement initiatives. These practices do not align with the principles of sustainable urban development, which prioritize inclusivity, transparency, and participatory
decision-making as outlined in the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), specifically the goal of Development of Sustainable Cities and Communities. To tackle these challenges, we need to create an Urban Planning and Citizen Engagement Platform that encourages community participation from the start and ensures transparency in the decision-making process.

**Objective of the Project**:

The homepage will feature a header that includes the logo, navigation menu (Home, Projects,
Maps, About, Contact), and a search bar. The hero section will offer a brief introduction to the
platform with call-to-action buttons such as "Explore Projects" and "Participate." Following this, a
carousel or grid of featured projects will display highlighted projects with images, titles, and brief
descriptions. Additionally, a list of recent forum discussions with links to full threads will be
included, and the footer will contain links to the privacy policy, terms of service, social media
icons, and contact information. The project detail page will be structured to provide a
comprehensive overview of each project. This will include a project overview section with the
title, description, a visual timeline, and a budget overview. An interactive map will show the
project location and related points of interest. The page will also feature an embedded
discussion forum and a feedback submission form for community engagement. A documents
and resources section will list downloadable documents and relevant resource links. The
updates and notifications section will display recent updates on the project and offer
a subscription option for notifications. The user dashboard for urban planners and local
government officials will include a navigation menu with options like Dashboard, My Projects,
Feedback, Reports, and Settings. The dashboard overview will provide a summary of active
projects, recent feedback, and notifications. The project management interface will allow users
to add new projects, upload documents, and set project timelines. Feedback monitoring tools
will enable viewing and responding to community feedback and analyzing survey results.
Additionally, the reports section will grant access to comprehensive reports on project progress
and community engagement metrics. Community forums will be categorized into various
discussion topics such as Urban Development, Public Services, and Community Events. Each
category will list recent discussion threads with titles, authors, and timestamps. A form for
posting new discussion threads, including fields for the title, category, and content, will also be
provided. Lastly, the notifications and updates section will feature a notification center listing
recent notifications related to projects, feedback, and updates. Users will have options to
manage their notification preferences, including email and SMS subscriptions. By carefully
crafting these wireframes and prototypes, we ensure that the platform is intuitive, engaging, and
effective in facilitating community engagement and transparent urban planning

**User’s Journey**:

Shubham Mishra, a community member and school teacher, embarks on a journey as he stumbles upon the Urban Planning and Citizen Engagement Platform during a local community event. Curious about the opportunity to be actively involved in urban development, he decides to check out the platform's homepage. Upon arrival, he is welcomed by a user-friendly interface that highlights prominent projects and recent discussions. Shubham efficiently navigates to the Projects section, where he thoroughly explores multiple ongoing projects by carefully browsing through detailed project pages. He has a strong fascination for a new park development in close proximity to his neighborhood. Having thoroughly analyzed the project overview, budget, visual timeline, and interactive map, Shubham is ready to share his insights. He actively engages in the embedded discussion forum, providing valuable feedback through the form, and ensures he stays up-to-date with the project's progress by subscribing for updates.

Meanwhile, Vedant Kashyap, an urban planner, accesses the platform's dashboard to oversee and track the progress of the park development project. Vedant efficiently updates the project timeline and uploads new documents to keep everyone informed of the latest design changes. He diligently keeps an eye on the community feedback section, where he comes across Shubham's astute comments along with feedback from other residents. Vedant carefully examines the feedback using advanced analytics tools, making necessary adjustments to the project plans in order to better meet the requirements of the community.
